# Longest Common Subsequence

| Solution Idx     | Time Complexity | Space Complexity | Comment                                 |
| ---------------- | --------------- | ---------------- | --------------------------------------- |
| 1                | O(m\*n)         | O(m\*n)          | DP, Typical Solution, 50%               |
| - (Not feasible) |                 |                  | Uncomplete solution space considiration |

## Way to Improve ?

Just like walking the maze, maybe there are some redundant move on the map.
