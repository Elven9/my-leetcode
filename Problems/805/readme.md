# Split Array With Same Average

| Solution Idx | Time Complexity | Space Complexity | Comment |
| ------------ | --------------- | ---------------- | ------- |
| 1            | O(n^2N)         | O(nN)            | DP      |

- Time complexity (solve by dp)
- Memory consumption (solve by compute dp backward)
- Algorithm correctness (shouldn't compute not existing value)
