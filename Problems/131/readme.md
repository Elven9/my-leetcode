# Palindrome Partitioning

| Solution Idx | Time Complexity | Space Complexity | Comment               |
| ------------ | --------------- | ---------------- | --------------------- |
| 1            | O(n!)           | Recur            | Backtracking Solution |

DP solution may be O(n^2), which is faster than backtracking. But it take much more space.

If this is the counting problem, it is more suitable to use dp solution

DP on palindrome testing, which is the part that consume most of the computation time.
